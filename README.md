# Bionic Reading App

A **desktop application** built with **PySide6** and **PyMuPDF**, providing a **Bionic Reading** experience for PDF and text files. This app allows you to **adjust bold ratio**, **letter spacing**, **line spacing**, **font family**, and **theme** to enhance reading speed and reduce visual strain.  

It also **persists user settings in a JSON** file, so each time you start the application, your last used preferences—like font size, theme (dark/light mode), and spacing—are all loaded automatically.

## Features

- **Load PDF or TXT**:
  - Automatically converts PDF text (via PyMuPDF) or reads `.txt` files and displays them in the editor.

- **Bionic Reading**:
  - Uses regex to split words from punctuation and bolds the first part of each word, allowing faster word recognition.

- **Adjustable Reading Settings**:
  - **Bold ratio**: How much of each word is bolded (e.g., 40%).
  - **Font size**: Ranging from 8 to 48pt.
  - **Letter spacing & line spacing**: Increase or decrease spacing for better readability.
  - **Font family**: Choose any system font or load your own.

- **Dark/Light Themes**:
  - Toggle theme with a checkbox, instantly switching between a dark mode and a light mode.

- **Refresh Button**:
  - Refresh the current text with the latest Bionic Reading settings.

- **Export**:
  - Export the processed text to **HTML** or **PDF**.

- **JSON-based Configuration**:
  - Automatically **loads** your last used settings from `config.json` on startup.
  - **Saves** updated settings whenever you change them.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** (recommended)
- Installed via `pip`:
  - `PySide6` for the GUI
  - `PyMuPDF` for PDF extraction
  - `weasyprint` for exporting to PDF
- (Optional) A local copy of `MiSans-Regular.otf` to load as the default UI font. 
  - You can use any other font if not available.

1. **Clone** or **download** this repository.
2. Place your custom font (optional) like `MiSans-Regular.otf` in the same directory if needed.
3. **Install** dependencies (PySide6, PyMuPDF, weasyprint).
4. **Run** the Python script:
   ```bash
   python BionicReader.py
   ```
5. On first run, the app creates (or reads) a `config.json` file in the same directory, storing your preferences.
